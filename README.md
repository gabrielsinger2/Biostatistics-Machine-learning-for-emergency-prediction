# Biostatistics-Machine-learning-for-emergency-prediction
The article we have studied proposes to predict, from a database concerning patients in the UK, their probability of being admitted to the emergency department. This approach is part of a context in which healthcare services are becoming increasingly strained. To achieve this, the authors
use machine learning algorithms (GradientBoostinClassifier, random forest) and compare them with a conventional medical algorithm (CPH). 

The final report offers a modest analysis of this article and takes a critical look at it from an AI perspective.
